# Scroll Improvement

#### Scroll more pixels smoothly with this improvement.

### Load the extension in Firefox

1. [Enable Epiphany extension](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Get-Started/wiki#how-to-enable-extensions). _Optional if not done._
2. Download the latest release from the [.xpi file](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Scroll-Improvement/releases/).
3. Follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Get-Started/wiki#how-to-install-extensions).

## The Why

Epiphany development relies heavily on WebkitGTK, some things are out of reach for developers who do a great job. One such problem is the [scroll speed](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168300).
This extension is a workaround for that, please if you can contribute, [please contribute upstream](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/).
